# BaldiGodotRecreation

### A Faithful Recreation of Baldi's Basics Classic in the Godot Engine.

The goal of this project is to put Baldi's Basics Classic into the Godot Engine while keeping the look and feel as close as possible to the source.

The reason why is because when I started making this, Unity has begun pushing out per-install fee which hurts game developers (especially indie devs), and alot of people were sick of having to deal with Unity's codebase and Mystman12's lack of skill and time back then.
